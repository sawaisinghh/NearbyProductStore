So the actual idea of this project is to create a environment where local shopkeeper may register their shops here, and can list all their available products on this website. And customer may search their product here and get the list of all nearby product stores where the searched product is available. And get the direction of that nearby local store. It saves time for customers to find their products in nearby area, they donâ€™t need to visit all the stores for finding their required products.
Basically, the Nearby Product Store is a website which can be accessible to those who have internet connection.
The website is for 3 types of people that varies from each other and they are:
1.	For shops
Shops may register themselves here, and add their available products on this website.
And get maximum customers reach on their shop locally.

2.	For customers
Customer will search their required product here and get the list of all nearby product store where the particular product is available. And get the direction of that store.

3.	Admin
Admin manage all the shops and site data. Admin can ban/remove any store from site if they are not following rules and regulations of the site. And receive all the query/complain from customers regarding site.
